Website of the [CoderDojo Luzern](https://coderdojoluzern.github.io/)

Thanks a lot to [coderdojo-linz](https://coderdojo-linz.github.io/) for allowing us to take their great website as base for this site.

## Development
This website is a GitHub Pages and is therefore built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/) manages the site's build process and publishes the site with every push to github.

See the [jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more details on how to work with jekyll.

### Quickstart Howto

* Install a full Ruby development environment
* Install Jekyll and bundler gems<br>
    ```gem install jekyll bundler```
* Change into the website directory<br>
    ```cd CoderDojoLuzern.github.io```
* Build the site and make it available on a local server<br>
    ```bundle exec jekyll serve```
    or
```jekyll serve```
* Now browse to http://localhost:4000

The website is automatically rebuilt when you change and save a file.
